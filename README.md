## Description

The project helps to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The application is built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM.

## Installation

- Install Node.js v16
- Install MongoDB
- Clone the Repository from GitHub and navigate to the root directory
- Install necessary dependencies running the following command :

  ```
  npm i
  ```

## Usage

The application can be invoked in the terminal by using the following command:

```

```

When the application is invoked using 'npm start' then the API server will start listening on port 3001 and the routes can be tested in Insomnia.
